<h2> How to view the Neowise comet</h2>
<h3> Three easy to follow steps</h3>
<p>The time to see the Neowise comet is fast approaching. Are you prepared for what you would need to do?</p>
<p>Local amateur photographer Jerry Hamblen says you can find it with these 3 easy steps </p>
<p>
    1. Find an open spot with the least amount of light pollution such as Lassen Volcanic National Park or the Shasta Dam.
</p>
<p>
    2. Set your fists on top of each other and fully straighten your arms. Put The bottom of your sacked fists on the horizon.
    The top of your stacked fists should be the height of the comet.
</p>
<p>
    3. To find the direction, use a compass or the compass app on your smartphone.
    When the compass hits 303, that is the direction of the comet. It should be just below the big dipper.
