<h2> Neowise Comet</h2>
<h3> What is the Neowise Comet?</h3>
<p>  Officially known as C/2020 F3, Comet NEOWISE is a comet that was discovered on March 27, 2020,
    by NEOWISE, the asteroid-hunting afterlife of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission.

<p>
    The comet made its closest approach to the sun on July 3 but, until now, was only visible in the sky before dawn.
    Now, for keen observers in the Northern Hemisphere, the comet has been getting higher in
    the evening sky, sparkling northwest below the Big Dipper constellation.

    The reason the Neowise comet is so interesting is becasue the comet istelf is so bright we are able to get more and better than we would typically.
    The comet is so bright you can see it with just your eyes, no telescope needed!
