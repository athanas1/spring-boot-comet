<h2>Information on Comets</h2>
<h3> Just what exactly are comets?</h3>
<p>
    Comets are icy bodies in space that release gas or dust. They are often compared to dirty snowballs,
    though recent research has led some scientists to call them snowy dirtballs. Comets contain dust, ice, carbon dioxide,
    ammonia, methane and more. Astronomers think comets are leftovers from the material that initially formed the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.
    Some researchers believe that comets are what originally brought water and organics to earth.

    As a comet gets closer to the sun, the ice on the surface of the nucleus begins turning into gas,
    forming a cloud known as the coma. Radiation from the sun pushes dust particles away from the coma,
    forming a dust tail, while charged particles from the sun convert some of the comet's gases into ions, forming an ion tail.
    Since comet tails are shaped by sunlight and the solar wind, they always point away from the sun

<p>
    We can see a number of comets with the naked eye when they pass close to the sun because their comas and tails reflect
    sunlight or even glow because of energy they absorb from the sun. However, most comets are too small or too faint to be seen without a telescope.
    Comets also leave a trail of debris that can lead to meteor showers.
